## Challenge Requirements

### String Manipulation: Sort of String

You are given N strings.

For each string, perform the following sorting operations:

1. Rearrange the alphabets in the string in terms of frequency. i.e. the alphabet having greater frequency comes first.
2. If two or more alphabets have the same frequency, the alphabet which is lexicographically small comes first.

Write a program to perform the above sorting operations.

#### Notes

1. The frequency of an alphabet is the number of times an alphabet appears in a string.
Example: Consider the string aabaac; here, the frequency of a is 3, frequency of b is 1, and frequency of c is 1.
2. Lexicographic order is the way of ordering words based on the alphabetical order of English letters i.e. "a" is the smallest letter and "z" is the
largest letter.

## Features

* Simple console application for the sorting method.
* Unit tests for the sorting method.

## Technologies

* .NET 6

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2022
